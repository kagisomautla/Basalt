# Basalt Assessment

This new project is an assessment for Basalt.

## Assessment Requirements

Using the marketstack.com API, build a flutter app that shows the stock market report of 10 random
companies. Add a date range and an auto complete search box to the UI. The autocomplete feature
should filter the list returned from the API. Also, notify the user if the device is offline. Add a
production-grade README file to your project and upload it on GitHub.
